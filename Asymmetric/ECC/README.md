This example demonstrates Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) using OpenSSL in C++, including key generation, message signing, and signature verification.

## Overview

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) provides the same cryptographic strength as RSA with significantly smaller key sizes, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments and modern applications requiring high performance.

## Algorithm Details

### Mathematical Foundation
- **Problem**: Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)
- **Curve equation**: y¬≤ = x¬≥ + ax + b (mod p) for prime curves
- **Point operations**: Point addition and scalar multiplication on elliptic curves
- **Security**: Based on difficulty of finding k given k√óG = P

### Key Parameters
- **Curve types**: secp256r1 (P-256), secp384r1 (P-384), secp521r1 (P-521)
- **Key sizes**: 256-bit, 384-bit, 521-bit (much smaller than equivalent RSA)
- **Security levels**: 128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit respectively
- **Performance**: Significantly faster than RSA for equivalent security

- DER encoding demonstration

## ECDSA Operations

### Key Generation
1. Select elliptic curve parameters
2. Generate random private key d
3. Calculate public key Q = d √ó G (where G is base point)

### Signature Generation
1. Hash message: h = SHA-256(message)
2. Generate random k
3. Calculate r = (k √ó G).x mod n
4. Calculate s = k‚Åª¬π(h + rd) mod n
5. Signature is (r, s)

### Signature Verification
1. Hash message: h = SHA-256(message)
2. Calculate u‚ÇÅ = h √ó s‚Åª¬π mod n
3. Calculate u‚ÇÇ = r √ó s‚Åª¬π mod n
4. Verify (u‚ÇÅ √ó G + u‚ÇÇ √ó Q).x ‚â° r mod n

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenSSL headers not found**
   ```
   Error: 'openssl/ec.h' file not found
   ```
   **Solution**: Install OpenSSL development libraries:
   ```bash
   brew install openssl
   ```

2. **Key files missing**
   ```
   Error: Cannot open ec_private.pem
   ```
   **Solution**: Generate keys first:
   ```bash
   make -f Makefile.key create
   ```

3. **Curve not supported**
   ```
   Error: Unknown curve name
   ```
   **Solution**: Use standard curves like secp256r1, secp384r1, or secp521r1.

4. **Invalid signature verification**
   ```
   Error: Signature verification failed
   ```
   **Solution**: Ensure message hasn't been modified and keys match.

### Performance Notes
- ECC is 5-10x faster than RSA for equivalent security
- Signature generation is faster than RSA signing
- Signature verification is much faster than RSA verification
- Key generation is significantly faster than RSA

## Historical Context

### Development Timeline

- Constant-time implementations for side-channel resistance

### Elliptic Curve Selection
- **secp256r1 (P-256)**: Most widely used, good balance of security/performance

- **Curve25519**: Modern curve with excellent security properties

### Security Best Practices
- **Use standard curves**: Avoid custom or experimental curves
- **Proper randomness**: Ensure secure random number generation for k
- **Validate points**: Always validate public key points are on curve

- **Key management**: Protect private keys with appropriate access controls

### Modern Developments
- **EdDSA**: Edwards curve digital signatures (Ed25519, Ed448)
- **X25519**: Curve25519 for key agreement
- **Post-quantum**: Preparing for quantum-resistant alternatives
- **Hardware support**: Increasing CPU support for ECC operations

## üí° Example Scenario

1. The program signs a message (`"Hello, ECC!"`) using the ECC private key.
2. It verifies the signature with the original message (should be valid).
3. It then attempts to verify the signature with a tampered message (`"Hello, ECC! (tampered)"`).
4. The result will be:

   ```
   Signature is valid!
   [Invalid case] Signature is invalid! (expected)
   ```

   because the signature does not match the modified message.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Real-World Applications

- ECC is used for digital signatures, secure communications, and blockchain.
- If the data is changed, the digital signature will no longer be valid.
- Ensures data is not forged and is signed by the correct person.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Always generate the key pair before signing/verifying.
- You can change the message in the code to test different scenarios.
