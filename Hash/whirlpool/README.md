# Whirlpool Hash Example

This example demonstrates the Whirlpool cryptographic hash function using OpenSSL in C++.

## Overview

Whirlpool is a cryptographic hash function designed by Vincent Rijmen (co-designer of AES) and Paulo S.L.M. Barreto. It's based on a modified Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Miyaguchi-Preneel mode.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenSSL headers not found**
   ```
   Error: 'openssl/evp.h' file not found
   ```
   **Solution**: Install OpenSSL development libraries:
   ```bash
   brew install openssl
   ```

2. **Whirlpool not available**
   ```
   Error: Unknown message digest whirlpool
   ```
   **Solution**: May require legacy provider in some OpenSSL 3.x builds:
   ```cpp
   OSSL_PROVIDER *legacy = OSSL_PROVIDER_load(NULL, "legacy");
   ```

3. **Performance considerations**
   ```
   Warning: Whirlpool slower than SHA-2
   ```
   **Note**: Whirlpool is computationally intensive due to AES-based design.

### Implementation Notes
- Whirlpool is slower than SHA-2 but provides different security foundation
- Memory usage is moderate
- Benefits from AES hardware acceleration on some platforms
- Constant-time implementations possible
