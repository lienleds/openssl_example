## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenSSL headers not found**
   ```
   Error: 'openssl/evp.h' file not found
   ```
   **Solution**: Install OpenSSL development libraries:
   ```bash
   brew install openssl
   ```

2. **SM3 not available**
   ```
   Error: Unknown message digest sm3
   ```
   **Solution**: Ensure OpenSSL 3.x is installed (SM3 support added in 1.1.1).

3. **Compilation errors on macOS**
   ```
   Error: cannot find -lssl -lcrypto
   ```
   **Solution**: Use provided Makefile with correct OpenSSL paths.
