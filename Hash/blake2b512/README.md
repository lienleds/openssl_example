| SHA-512   | 512 bits  | 1024 bits  | High        | 256 bits      |
| SHA-256   | 256 bits  | 512 bits   | High        | 128 bits      |
| SHA3-512  | 512 bits  | 1152 bits  | Medium      | 256 bits      |

## Use Cases

### Recommended Applications
- **File integrity verification**: Fast checksums for large files
- **Digital signatures**: High-performance hash for signature schemes
- **Key derivation**: Secure password-based key generation
- **Merkle trees**: Efficient hash tree construction
- **General hashing**: Modern replacement for legacy algorithms

### Performance Benefits
- Optimized for 64-bit architectures
- SIMD instruction support
- Cache-friendly memory access patterns
- Parallel processing capabilities

## Security Properties

### Cryptographic Strength
- **Pre-image resistance**: Computationally infeasible to find input for given hash
- **Second pre-image resistance**: Hard to find different input with same hash
- **Collision resistance**: Extremely difficult to find two inputs with same hash
- **Avalanche effect**: Small input changes cause large output changes

### Modern Security
- No known cryptographic weaknesses
- Resistant to length extension attacks
- Suitable for long-term security applications
- Cryptanalysis-resistant design

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenSSL headers not found**
   ```
   Error: cannot find -lssl -lcrypto
   ```
   **Solution**: Install OpenSSL development libraries:
   ```bash
   brew install openssl
   ```

2. **Compilation errors on macOS**
   ```
   Error: 'openssl/evp.h' file not found
   ```
   **Solution**: Use Makefile with correct OpenSSL paths (already configured).

3. **Legacy provider errors**
   ```
   Error: BLAKE2b not available
   ```
   **Solution**: BLAKE2b is in default provider, ensure OpenSSL 3.x is installed.

### Performance Notes
- BLAKE2b512 is typically 25-50% faster than SHA-512
- Optimized implementations can achieve >1 GB/s on modern CPUs
- Memory usage is minimal compared to SHA-3 family

## Historical Context

### Development
- **2012**: BLAKE2 designed by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Samuel Neves, Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn, and Christian Winnerlein
- **2013**: Finalized specification published
- **Goal**: Create faster alternative to SHA-2 while maintaining security
- **Influence**: Based on BLAKE (SHA-3 finalist) and ChaCha cipher

### Adoption
- Included in many cryptographic libraries
- Used in Tor, WireGuard, and other security-critical applications
- Recommended by security experts as SHA-2 alternative
- Growing adoption in modern cryptographic protocols
